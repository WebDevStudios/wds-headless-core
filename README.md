As of 02/27/2024, this repository has been archived and is now read-only. 

This project is outdated and no longer being maintained. WebDevStudios has developed different methods for headless WordPress projects that we may publish to a public repo in the future.  We are grateful for the engagement here, and for all contributions and discussions.

While this repository is no longer actively maintained, we're keeping it available for historical reference and for those who might still find the code useful.

For the latest on our projects and developments, please visit https://webdevstudios.com

Thank you for your support and contributions over the years. We hope you continue to find value in our past work and join us in our new ventures.
